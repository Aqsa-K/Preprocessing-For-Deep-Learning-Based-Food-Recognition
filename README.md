# Preprocessing-For-Deep-Learning-Based-Food-Recognition

The following is the link to a report on 'Deep Learing Based Food Recognition' by students from Stanford University. The authors have used some preprocessing methods before feeding the data for training.

The code here deals with the preprocessing steps only; Grey World and Histogram Equalization.
